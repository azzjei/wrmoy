<p>I'm not too sure why Cinnamoroll </p>
    <p>reminds me of you. It could be </p>
        <p>the fact that he was the only close</p>
        <p>one in sanrio. But yet he's so far. </p>
            <p> However every thing surrounding </p>
                <p>him reminds me of you. It makes </p>
                    <p>me think of you anytime I see him. </p>
                    <p>  I couldn't tell you why.</p>

<p>I think you, my husband, are these two colors, </p>
<p>green and red. First off, I feel like you'd be more </p>
<p>of a misty snowy evergreen tree forest, with the </p>
<p>wind blowing. It's cold, but it's not so cold to the </p>
<p>point you're freezing. It's like a breeze that sends</p>
<p>chills down your spine because it's so sweet and </p>
<p>nice that it's refreshing and makes you feel excited </p>
<p>and happy. It's still cold but it's a cold you can </p>
<p>embrace. The type you could sit in for hours without </p>
<p>budging because its so good. You'd be a deep ever</p>
<p>green, because deep colors are so calming. You're a</p>
<p>very calm and lighthearted person, in which gives</p>
<p>you the dark green. However it's an evergreen in</p>
<p>the snow specifically because it gives it such a soft </p>
<p> color, and snow gives it such a soft crunch. It's </p>
<p>exactly how sweet in a soft sense you are with me. </p>
<p>Even when we are joking around you still make sure </p>
<p>to be sweet with me and make sure I know you're</p>
<p>joking. You take care of my every need. It also </p>
<p>represents the way you texts. You text in all lower</p>
<p>case in which I adore. It sets such a soft tone. The </p>
<p>caps every so often, the lower case most of the </p>
<p>time. The periods sometimes. I love how you speak </p>
<p>and never want you to change a single thing about </p>
<p>it. You'd be an evergreen because their winter beauty</p>
<p>is immaculate. Their beauty goes beyond what any </p>
<p>has seen, in which is how i feel with you.</p>

<img src="moon.PNG" class="mocha_bow">
<p>The moon reminds me of you because, despite the  </p>
<p>way your love me makes me feel, I feel like you are  </p>
<p>the moon. You're so cool in nature and calm, with  </p>
<p>your own spark. Youre just like the moon because  </p>
<p>it glows extremely bright yet it's so underrated.  </p>
<p>Everyone sleeps through the beauty of it but when  </p>
<p>I look at it I have to hold my breath, the sight is so  </p>
<p>beautiful. Thats how I feel with you. It also reminds  </p>
<p>me of you because you're such a night owl. Youre  </p>
<p>either up so late or you're sleeping constantly. I  < </p>
<p>believe it matches your energy perfectly. And </p>
<p>the way the moon has imperfections in it, such  </p>
<p>as its craters. But those are what make it beautiful.  </p>
<p>It wouldn't be complete without its "imperfections".  </p>
<p>An nothing or no one is ever perfect. The fact you  </p>
<p>have imperfections shows you do actually feel things  </p>
<p>and you are human and not just some follower of  </p>
<p>other people. Your your own self and I appreciate  </p>
<p>that. Just like the moon. Its also not as if people don't  </p>
<p>see your beauty I'm sure they do, but it's so missed </p>
<p> out on by a lot. But the moon is so beautiful it has  </p>
<p>so many people who lived to study it. I believe I'll  </p>
<p>always be there for you to love and admire you.  </p>

<img src="cherry.PNG" class="mocha_bow">
<p>Cherries remind me of you because of the times </p>
<p>you've said you've like them. Ever since that day </p>
<p>they've reminded me of you. Cherries also symbolize </p>
<p>quite a bit of things. The ones that fit most for us are</p>
<p>love/romance, beauty, desire, production/happiness, </p>
<p>and strength/motivation. Love reminds me of us be</p>
<p>cause I love you so much. Beauty, because you've </p>
<p>shown me that I can find myself beautiful in so many </p>
<p>ways, and you yourself find me beautiful. It's also be</p>
<p>cause you are the most beautiful guy I've ever met. </p>
<p>Your looks go beyond this world. Honestly don't know </p>
<p>how you look how you do because you're so perfect. </p>
<p>Desire is one because I trust we both desire one another </p>
<p>in many ways. Production and happiness because you </p>
<p>have already been such a help in both of these for me. </p>
<p>Of course I don't depend on you for it but you've definitely</p>
<p>shown me I can be happy and productive. Lastly strength </p>
<p>and motivation. Motivation being the same, strength being</p>
<p>very similar. </p>

<img src="rasp.PNG" class="mocha_bow">
<p>As for red I feel like you'd be a deep raspberry. The deep color</p>
    <p>shows how calm you normally are, with the tangy sensation of the </p>
        <p>raspberry showing odd other sides of your personality. The way </p>
            <p>raspberries are so messy represents you perfectly, as you can be a </p>
                <p>bit scatterbrained, but the ridges and everything on the raspberry</p>
                    <p>are so perfect no matter any "imperfections" it's still perfect, and </p>
                        <p>shows how perfect in my eyes you are and how amazing you are</p>
                            <p>It also gives away how kind you are. The way you are is why I love </p>
                                <p> you and I hope you never changes for anyone because you're </p>
                                    <p> perfect.</p>
<img src="divi.PNG" class="mocha_bow">
<img src="straw.PNG" class="mocha_bow">
<p>Strawberries remind me of you because when I brought </p>
    <p>up my love for them with you, it has only grown, such as my </p>
<p>love for you has grown. Strawberries are so sweet exactly like</p>
<p>you. Even with bumps and mishaps in the strawberries I'd still </p>
 <p>eat them gratefully because despite the imperfections, the taste </p>
 <p>is still the same. It will always have that sweet taste that you can</p>
 <p>never get over. Just like how I'll never get over how sweet you </p>
  <p>are. And no matter the imperfections you show me is still run </p>
  <p>right back to you happily. It also reminds me of you because </p>
  <p>strawberries symbolize love, fertility, and new beginnings. The </p>
  <p>fertility not so much, but the love and new beginnings relate to </p>
  <p>you so much. The love one because u love you closely and dearly.</p> 
  <p>The new beginnings because genuinely you've given me things I </p>
  <p>never knew I could even have. And you treat me so differently. </p>
  <p>You've healed me and loved me in so many ways.</p>
